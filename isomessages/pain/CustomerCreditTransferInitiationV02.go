// Scope
// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message is sent by the initiating party to the forwarding agent or debtor agent. It is used to request movement of funds from the debtor account to a creditor.
// Usage
// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message can contain one or more customer credit transfer instructions.
// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message is used to exchange:
// - One or more instances of a credit transfer initiation;
// - Payment transactions that result in book transfers at the debtor agent or payments to another financial institution;
// - Payment transactions that result in an electronic cash transfer to the creditor account or in the emission of a cheque.
// The message can be used in a direct or a relay scenario:
// - In a direct scenario, the message is sent directly to the debtor agent. The debtor agent is the account servicer of the debtor.
// - In a relay scenario, the message is sent to a forwarding agent. The forwarding agent acts as a concentrating financial institution. It will forward the CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message to the debtor agent.
// The message can also be used by an initiating party that has authority to send the message on behalf of the debtor. This caters for example for the scenario of a payments factory initiating all payments on behalf of a large corporate.
// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message can be used in domestic and cross-border scenarios.
// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message must not be used by the debtor agent to execute the credit transfer instruction(s). The FIToFICustomerCreditTransfer message must be used instead.
// If it is agreed to include the payment information related to the debit side only once (i.e. Grouped mode), the PaymentInformation block will be present only once.
// If it is agreed to repeat the payment information related to the debit side (i.e. Single mode), the PaymentInformation block must be present once per occurrence of the CreditTransferTransactionInformation block.
// The CustomerCreditTransferInitiation message also allows for a Mixed mode where the PaymentInformation block can be repeated and each PaymentInformation block can contain one or several CreditTransferTransactionInformation block(s).
// Single
// When grouping is set to Single, information for each individual instruction is included separately. This means the
// PaymentInformation block is repeated, and present for each occurrence of the CreditTransferTransactionInformation block.
// Grouped
// When grouping is set to Grouped, the PaymentInformation block will be present once and the CreditTransferTransactionInformation block will be repeated.
// Mixed
// When grouping is set to Mixed, the PaymentInformation block may be present once or may be repeated. Each sequence
// of the PaymentInformation block may contain one or several CreditTransferTransactionInformation block(s).
