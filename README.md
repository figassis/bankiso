# iso20022

Go implementation of the ISO 20022 standard

This package consumes valid iso20022 XML strings and returns Go structs to be processed by an iso20022 application.


# Setup
go get github.com/figassis/bankiso  
go get github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew  --for debugging purposes only. Not required if not building

cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/figassis/bankiso
go build  


# Testing

./bankiso -f bankiso -f msg-examples/payments/pain.009.001.04/business3-pain.009.001.04.xml

# Usage in a project
Take a look at https://github.com/figassis/bankiso/blob/master/main.go

Each iso20022 schema results in a different struct, and therefore a different go type.
I've decided to use interfaces, type assertions and type switches to provide a sane way to handle all messages.

Iâ€™ve created an interface ISOMessage, which all iso20022 (and later 8583) messages implement, so they can all be returned from the same function.

The package maintains a library of struct types that it picks according to the message code it reads from the XML string.

A function then unmarshals the XML into the chosen struct and returns an ISOMessage.

You can then use a type switch to type assert the message and call the correct handling function.
